## API Documentation

### Transfer Operations

#### Create Transfer
```http
POST /api/transfers
Content-Type: application/json

    "from_account": "123",
    "to_account": "456",
    "amount": 100.50
}

```http
POST /api/webhook/transfer
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transfer_id": "transfer_id",
    "status": "COMPLETED"
}

Response:
{
    "message": "Transfer status updated successfully"
}
```

## Error Handling

- HTTP 400: Bad Request (invalid input)
- HTTP 404: Not Found (resource not found)
- HTTP 500: Internal Server Error
- HTTP 429: Too Many Requests

## Data Flow

1. Client initiates transfer -> `/api/transfers`
2. Transfer is created with PENDING status
3. Service responds immediately with PENDING status
4. External system processes payment
5. Webhook notification received -> `/api/webhook/transfer`
6. Transfer status updated in database
7. Balances updated if COMPLETED
8. Timeout mechanism if no webhook received
